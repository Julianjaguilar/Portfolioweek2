# Portfolioweek2
This is my Homework for week 2 where i am creating my own portfolio using CSS and HTML!

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

In this Project my main goal is to be able to Succesfully make a portfolio where my projects can be placed. I will be wireframing first to get an idea of what my Portfolio will look like. I then will create an repository with my Index.html and my CSS. my main goal is to add elements into my projects like when the cursor is over the selected object it will use some type of element to create a glow or interaction with the cursor.
